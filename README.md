# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures, including stack, queues, and lists. Each data structure is implemented using both array-based and linked-based approaches. Additionally, you'll find practical applications showcasing the usage of these data structures.
